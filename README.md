# xu-DdProfileTest
Dandan Xu has provided a sample of 36 lensing galaxies at redshift 0.6 with various source positions and projections.
The source light is then ray-traced to yield image positions on the sky. The files listed in RayTracing_SubhaloID.list
contains the lens galaxy parameters, while the files listed in QuadsTimeDelays.list contain source positions, 
image positions, time delays and magnification of each image for a given source position. However, this data
cannot be publicly available as per Dandan's request.
The goal of this code is to see if lens galaxies with different profile shape, projection and different pairs of
images yield consistent value of angular diameter distancei to each other.
